# task-extraction-nlp
This project focuses on extracting and categorizing tasks from textual data using NLP techniques. It preprocesses text, identifies tasks based on action verbs, and groups them into categories using Word2Vec and LDA. The system also extracts responsible persons and deadlines to provide structured task insights.
